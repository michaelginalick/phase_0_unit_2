# U2.W5: Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge with Carl Krause.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# loads the code from the file named 'state_data' (?why no filename extension?) 
# and raises and error if file isn't found
#
require_relative 'state_data'

  # => have been defined in class VirusPredictor, but you could not choose to call the method 
  # => on an instance of the class. For example, you couldn't call virus_effects on Alabama 
  # => in the driver code (which would cause driver code to break).
