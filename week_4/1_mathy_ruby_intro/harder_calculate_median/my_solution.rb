# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?


# 2. Initial Solution

def median(array)
    array.sort
    num = array.length
   if num == even?
      array % 2
    else
      array % (array.length-1 + array.length -2)/2)
end
